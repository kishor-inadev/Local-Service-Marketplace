# Production Readiness Report

**Local Service Marketplace Platform**
**Generated:** April 2026 (last updated: BullMQ workers migration complete)
**Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION (with noted exceptions)**

---

## Executive Summary

All blocking issues have been resolved. The platform is ready for production deployment. Two non-blocking limitations remain (email delivery + real payment gateway) which are expected until those external credentials are provisioned.

## 2. Docker Build Status

All 10 Dockerfiles build successfully.

**Resilience fix applied:** All NestJS service Dockerfiles include a 3-attempt corepack retry with `npm install -g pnpm@9.12.3 --force` as final fallback, guarding against transient TLS errors in build environments.

**comms-service** uses a `pnpm prune --prod` + `node_modules` copy pattern in the production stage, eliminating a second network install step.

---

## 3. Code Quality

### Backend Services (NestJS)

- ✅ Zero `TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` markers in production source files
- ✅ File upload service (`identity-service`) fully implemented — `uploadFile`, `uploadMultiple`, `deleteFile` all functional
- ✅ Provider welcome email uses real user email lookup (not synthetic address)
- ✅ TypeScript `baseUrl` deprecation silenced via `"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"` across all services
- ✅ `comms-service` `tsconfig.json` explicit `rootDir: "./src"` added

### email-service (Node.js)

- ✅ Graceful degradation: service starts and stays healthy even when `EMAIL_USER` / `EMAIL_PASS` are unconfigured
- ✅ `/health` endpoint returns `200` unconditionally (used by Docker health check)
- ✅ `sendEmail()` returns `503 ServiceUnavailable` with a clear message when SMTP is not configured instead of crashing
- ✅ Startup no longer crashes on SMTP verification failure — logs a warning and continues

### Frontend (Next.js)

- ✅ Zero `TODO` / `FIXME` markers
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` corrected to `http://localhost:3700` (was wrongly set to `3800`)
- ✅ Production security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ✅ Standalone output mode enabled for Docker builds
- ✅ Performance budgets set in webpack config

---

## 3b. Background Workers (BullMQ)

All 6 backend services have been fully migrated from Bull to **BullMQ** (`@nestjs/bullmq` + `bullmq`).

| Service | Queues | Repeatable Jobs | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| identity-service | 4 | token-cleanup, session-cleanup | ✅ |
| marketplace-service | 4 | rating-recalculation, stale-job-cleanup | ✅ |
| payment-service | 5 | expired-coupon-cleanup, payment-analytics | ✅ |
| comms-service | 6 | email-digest, notification-cleanup | ✅ |
| oversight-service | 3 | daily-analytics-aggregation | ✅ |
| infrastructure-service | 3 | infra-event-cleanup | ✅ |

**Total: 22 queues across 6 services.**

Workers are opt-in via `WORKERS_ENABLED=true`. All services start and function correctly without workers (non-critical background tasks are skipped).

- ✅ All `@Cron` decorators and `@nestjs/schedule` removed from all services
- ✅ All repeatable jobs registered via BullMQ `addBulk()` on worker startup
- ✅ Worker modules guard-loaded only when `WORKERS_ENABLED=true`
- ✅ `WorkerConcurrency` configurable via `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` env var

## 4. Environment Variables

| `PAYMENT_GATEWAY`                      | ✅ `mock` | Safe default until real PSP credentials added                 |
| `EMAIL_USER` / `EMAIL_PASS`            | ✅ Set    | Brevo (smtp-relay.brevo.com) SMTP — fallback Gmail configured |
| `STRIPE_*` / `RAZORPAY_*` / `PAYPAL_*` | Empty     | Intentional — `PAYMENT_GATEWAY=mock`                          |

## 5. Security Posture

- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT access tokens (15 min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- ✅ Rate limiting on all services
- ✅ CORS restricted to `http://localhost:3000` (update to production domain)
- ✅ Sensitive actions logged with `user_id` + `request_id` + `timestamp`
- ✅ Login attempts tracked (identity-service)
- ✅ API Gateway validates tokens before forwarding to backend services
- ✅ `x-user-*` headers injected by gateway; backend services never re-validate JWT
- ✅ Helmet + Content-Security-Policy applied on frontend
- ✅ HSTS header configured (max-age 2 years)

---

## 6. Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

### 6.1 Email Delivery

- **Status:** ✅ Configured — Brevo SMTP (`smtp-relay.brevo.com:587`) with Gmail fallback
- **Impact:** Transactional emails (OTP, welcome, password reset) will be delivered

### 6.2 Real Payment Processing

- **Status:** Mock mode (`PAYMENT_GATEWAY=mock`)
- **Impact:** Payments succeed/fail with mock responses — no real money moved
- **Fix:** Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and change `PAYMENT_GATEWAY=stripe`

### 6.3 CORS Origin

- **Current:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Required for production:** Change to your actual production domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
- **File:** `docker.env` → `CORS_ORIGIN=`

### 6.4 Facebook OAuth

- **Status:** Placeholder credentials in `frontend/.env`
- **Impact:** Facebook login button will fail if shown to users
- **Fix:** Set real `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` / `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` or hide the button

---

## 7. Deployment Checklist

Before production go-live, complete the following:

- [x] Set `EMAIL_USER` + `EMAIL_PASS` in `docker.env` for transactional email (✅ Brevo SMTP configured)
- [ ] Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (or chosen PSP) and update `PAYMENT_GATEWAY`
- [ ] Change `CORS_ORIGIN` to production frontend domain
- [ ] Change `FRONTEND_URL` to production domain
- [ ] Set `AUTH_SECRET` in `frontend/.env` to a strong random value (not dev default)
- [ ] Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` / `AUTH_URL` to production frontend URL
- [ ] Update `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` in identity-service to production URL
- [ ] Enable HTTPS on load balancer / reverse proxy
- [ ] Run `docker-compose up -d --build` with final production env file
- [ ] Run `pnpm test:api` (Newman suite) against production endpoints to verify
